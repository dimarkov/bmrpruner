# Sparse T5

This directory is very similar to the vanilla T5X "T5" example, but demonstrates
a host of techniques to spasify a language model using various pruning 
algorithms from the `jaxpruner` library.

Refer to the [mainREADME](https://github.com/google-research/t5x/blob/main/README.md) 
for the example usages.
